# Speed log

Decode speed of `main` after each performance change, measured on rented GPUs. One row per
(change, GPU, model, streams). `bench_batch --q4` (greedy, no speculation, 256 tokens for 8B
and 128 for 32B, `mlx-community/Qwen3-*-4bit`) unless the row says zest-harness. tok/s is
total across streams. Speed of light is the weight bytes a step over HBM bandwidth (8B ~4.26 GB,
32B ~18.4 GB; H200 4.8 TB/s, H100 SXM 3.35 TB/s): 8B 1120 tok/s on an H200 and 790 on an
H100, 32B 260 and 182. % is of that, for one stream. Rows compare against the previous row
for the same GPU, model and streams; GPUs differ run to run (±5%), so treat changes under
~5% as noise unless the same pod measured both.

## gpt-oss-20b

Single stream, AA-style (a ~1k-token chat prompt, output tok/s; `scripts/gpt_oss_speed.sh`).
The bar is Groq's claimed ~1,200 tok/s.

**Bytes per decoded token** (what a step must read; gpt-oss-20b, 24 layers):

| part | format | per token |
|---|---|---:|
| experts: 4 of 32 per layer, gate/up 5760×2880 + down 2880×2880 | MXFP4 (4.25 bits) | 1.27 GB |
| attention Q/K/V/O, 26.5M a layer | bf16 | 1.27 GB |
| output head 201088×2880 | bf16 | 1.16 GB |
| KV at ~1.3k context (12 full layers ~1.3k keys, 12 sliding 128), f32 | | ~0.05 GB |
| router, norms, biases | f32 | ~0.01 GB |
| **total** | | **~3.75 GB** |

Speed of light at that size: 1280 tok/s on an H200 (4.8 TB/s), 890 on an H100, 270 on a 4090.
Groq's 1,200 is ~94% of the H200's. **To pass it, the weights have to shrink:** attention and
the head at 4 bits (Q4, as the Qwen rows run) would take a token to ~1.95 GB, a 2460 tok/s ceiling
on the H200. The experts are already 4-bit.

**Per kernel** (4090 nsys, 256 decoded tokens, before the 4-rows-a-warp GEMV): the expert GEMV
was 48% of GPU time at ~350 GB/s (a third of peak) and the bf16 GEMVs 36% at ~0.94 TB/s (at
peak). Sink attention was 6%, rms_norm 4%. Host side: ~460 launches a token, with a
host-to-device upload (ids, block tables) and a logits download every step.

| kernel | bytes/token | at 4.8 TB/s | measured | what's left |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `moe_gemv_mxfp4` (48 calls) | 1.27 GB | 0.26 ms | 4090: 3.6 ms → ~2.2 ms after 4 rows a warp | input staged in smem (new, A/B below); more columns a block |
| `gemv_bf16` attention (48 calls) | 1.27 GB | 0.26 ms | at bandwidth | 4-bit attention weights |
| `gemv_bf16` head (1 call) | 1.16 GB | 0.24 ms | at bandwidth | 4-bit head, or device top-k so only the argmax comes back |
| `attn_sink_partial` + combine | ~0.05 GB | 0.01 ms | 6% (launch-bound) | fold into fewer launches |
| everything else (~360 launches) | | | ~1.5 ms on H100 | CUDA graphs |

Measured so far (before the rebase onto #88/#89):

| date | commit | change | GPU | model | streams | tok/s | % SoL | vs prev |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-20 | 29221a7 | #95, 13-token prompt | RTX 4090 | gpt-oss-20b | 1 | 157 | 58% | |
| 2026-10-20 | 1b8474c | #95, 13-token prompt | H100 | gpt-oss-20b | 1 | 182 | 20% | |
| 2026-10-20 | 1b8474c | #95, 13-token prompt | H100 | gpt-oss-120b | 1 | 119 | | |

**Plan for when gpt-oss is back in focus** (on hold since 2026-10-21; 30% of zest goes to
speed, all of it on Coder-Next and tang-pro for now). In order, each with what's ready:

1. **Q4 attention and head**, the path past Groq: 3.75 → ~1.95 GB a token, H200 ceiling
   1280 → ~2460 tok/s. `--q4` already quantizes attention, the embedding and the head at load
   (affine 4-bit, group 64) and the 4-bit GEMV serves them. Correctness checked offline:
   `scripts/gpt_oss_q4_check.py` applies the same rounding to transformers' weights, and tang
   `--q4` matches it at max KL 1.1e-4 (tiny model, CPU). Still unmeasured: what Q4 costs the
   real 20b. `gpt_oss_speed.sh` measures it (`--q4` vs bf16 KL, 256 positions) beside the speed.
   If the head costs too much, keep the head bf16 and quantize attention only (1.27 GB saved of
   the 1.8), or try group 32.
2. **The MXFP4 GEMV A/B** (input via L1, the default, vs staged in shared memory,
   `TANG_MOE_GEMV=smem`), in the same script. The smem kernel has not run on a GPU yet.
3. **CUDA graphs over the decode step**: the H100 step is launch-bound (~460 launches a token).
4. **Speculation**: already exact for gpt-oss (`tests/speculate.rs` passes on CUDA).

One H200 hour covers 1 and 2 (`scripts/gpt_oss_speed.sh <gpt-oss-20b dir>`; it prints these
rows and an nsys summary).

## Dead ends

Tried and measured at under 3% (or worse):

- **4-bit GEMV, a warp a column, x read through L1 (no shared-memory stage):** 30% slower at one
  row, worse with more rows (L1 traffic is 8x the weight bytes per extra row).
- **GEMV with the next stage's weights double-buffered in registers:** 5-15% slower; register
  pressure cut occupancy.
- **GEMV, 2 columns a warp instead of 4:** 2-10% slower.
- **GEMV K-split sizing, 1 / 4 / 8 / 16 blocks an SM:** within 3% of each other once the
  128-bit loads are in; 4 kept.
- **GEMV with the whole K slice of x resident in shared memory and every weight load issued up
  front (`gemv_q4_xr`, 2026-10-21, H200):** 8B solo 207 → 130 tok/s, 32B 71 → 36. Registers
  (16 uint4 of weights a lane) leave one 8-warp block an SM, and a block loads everything,
  then computes: no overlap between one block's math and the next one's loads. The fix has to
  keep several blocks (or a load pipeline) per SM.
- **Device top-k for a lone stream:** 1.5% slower than sampling its one row on the host;
  only batches cut on the device.
- **The VRAM-pressure check on pool misses only (#81)** measured +1.5% alone. It's kept because
  it takes ~2.6 ms of CPU off each step, which matters once kernels stop hiding host time.

## Qwen3-Coder-Next (qwen3next Flash engine)

`Qwen3-Coder-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` (unsloth, 49.6 GB), the Flash engine's qwen3next path
(`src/flash/coder.rs`), one stream, greedy. A step reads 3.42 GB at a 1.3k context (3.52 GB at
4k): dense weights, 10 routed + 1 shared expert a layer, head, K/V. Speed of light is that over
HBM bandwidth: 1,400 tok/s on an H200, 970 on an H100 SXM.

AA rows are `flash-aa`, Artificial Analysis-style: a ~1.24k-token chat prompt (one of
`explain` / `refactor` / `write`, the same 140-line Rust file with a different task), 512
output tokens, tok/s after the first token. The fastest public API for this model is Novita at
174 tok/s.

Stage sweep on that H200 pod (`TANG_CODER_STAGES=1`: each stage alone in a CUDA graph, replayed;
µs a step at a 1.3k context, window 4,856 µs): routed+shared gate|up 876 (771 GB/s), down 801
(501 GB/s), GDN input GEMV 618 (1.6 TB/s), GDN output 301, top-k 286, GDN conv+step 238,
moe combine+norm 214, attention split-K 207 (154 GB/s), router 176, head 174, post-mixer norm
166, attention in/out 260. The stages sum to 4,461 µs, so launch gaps are ~8% of the window.

### Dead ends (Coder-Next)

- **22 → 12 launches a layer with no faster kernels:** +2% (156 → 159 on H100). The step is
  kernel-latency-bound, not launch-bound.
- **Expert GEMVs, 4 rows a warp** (all staged before decoding): −4% vs 2.
- **K-split GEMV with 8 warps a row** instead of 4: −7%. Both together: −10%.
- **SiLU + int8 of h fused into the down kernel:** −2% vs a separate launch (each down block
  recomputes its pair's 512 values; the extra latency outweighs the saved launch).
- **The eager event profiler** (`TANG_CODER_PROF`) put about 2× the graph's time on small
  kernels. Use the stage sweep for decisions.
- **Top-k in the router GEMV's last block** (atomic counter, one launch fewer): −2% (217 → 213).
  The last block's serial top-k costs more than the launch it saves.
- **K-split routed experts** (Q warps a row, unstaged, like `cx_gemvk`): gate|up −4% / −6% /
  −16% at Q = 1 / 2 / 4, down +0.5% / −6% / −18%. Experts want the staged rows; the dense
  matrices want the split.
- **K-split GEMV, 1 warp a row** (no split): −1.5% vs 4, −6% vs 2.
- **A Qwen3 drafter** (estimate, not built): teacher-forced top-1 agreement with the engine's
  greedy output is 58 / 88 / 71% for Qwen3-0.6B and 62 / 90 / 77% for 1.7B
  (explain / refactor / write). A verify window of 8 costs ~3× a T=1 step here (each token
  routes to its own experts), so a drafter only pays on refactor-like text, which the free
  suffix drafter already covers (2.7 tokens a window). Expected gain on fresh text ≤10%, for a
  second model engine. Not worth building yet.
- **First rows of a `flash-aa` run** read ~4% low (205 vs 213–217 for the same kernels later in
  the run). Compare variants inside the A/B block, which warms up first.
- **bf16 router weights** (`TANG_CODER_ROUTER16=1`): +1% (240.8 → 243.1), under the bar. The
  router is 4.2 MB a layer of F32 but reads at ~1.1 TB/s either way. Kept opt-in.
- **nsys / ncu on the RunPod image:** ncu's injection lacks `cuTensorMapEncodeIm2colWide`,
  which cudarc resolves at load, and nsys isn't installed (apt fails).

//! Who's in the batch: the rules the server's worker follows between decode steps (see
//! `docs/batching.md`). Pure, so they're tested without a model.
//!
//! Requests join while there's a free KV slot, their conversation isn't already running (it
//! has one cache) and the KV budget has room; the interactive lane goes first. Running streams
//! share each step's prefill budget in lane order: interactive before background, then by
//! arrival. A background stream that's still prefilling gives way when interactive work is
//! waiting that couldn't join (its slot is what it needs); one that's decoding keeps going.
